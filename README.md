# WordGuessGame

This is a hangman game.
The computer will have a word chosen, and your job is to guess the word.

Start by pressing a letter. 
If the letter is in the word that was chosen, it will show wherever it is present in the word.
If the letter is not in the word, the letter will appear below "Letters Already Guessed".
Be careful as you only have 12 guesses to guess the word correctly!
